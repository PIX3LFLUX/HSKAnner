___

+	order development setup dev-1-10 (1 CN, 10 SN)
	+	10 SN
	+	1 CN
	+	48-port PoE Switch, 5 new 40mm fans for said switch
	+	11 network cables, shielded with foil, 7.5m
+	physical assembly of dev-1-10
	+	assembly of CN
	?	assembly of all SN;	one Raspberry Pi 4B faulty
	+	fan swap in ethernet switch;	temperature is fine with 31Â°C @ 32W with 9 SN connected and running for over two hours
	?	connecting the SN with the CN and cable-managing;	one cable has damaged data lines and is thus useless
+	establishing communication between SN and CN
	+	able to take a photo (1 SN) using the terminal with a single command and having it available locally at the CN
	+	same but with 10 SN;	since one is broken, only 9, but proof of concept is given.
	+	script for taking photos at specific settings with automated folder structuring
+	alignment of SN with ideal photogrammetry object (stone)
	+	take photos with script and compute manually in the meshroom gui
	?	if necessary, generate scripts for 2d and 3d filtering;	seems unneeded, will proceed without it for now. maybe adding it in a later stage
+	automate mesh generating process
-	design and virtual test of the final scanner: dev-1-45
	-	figure out camera positions and do photogrammetry with the virtual cameras to confirm function
	-	figure out lighting positions and intensity
	-	develop a system for controlling the lighting from the command line for easy integration (possibly esp8266 as controller, USB-serial interface for controlling, preferably a cheap uC with arduino support and ethernet. since we need a PSU for the LEDs, we can power the LN from that.)
	-	design easy and cheap to manufacture "pillars" for holding brightness lights, cosmetic lights, SNs, LN in the calculated positions
	-	pillars: 
		-	airflow from bottom to top so that convection helps us
		-	PoE might not be needed since we need a PSU for the LN anyways
		-	holder for length of ethernet cable that is over the required length
		-	balance weight so that it does not tip over with ease
		-	puzzle piece-like contraption to help align the pillars for the scanning setup
-	LN development
	-	ordering of LN
	-	assembly of LN
	-	firmware for LN
-	ordering the remaining parts of dev-1-45
	- 35 SN
	- 35 ethernet cables
	- hardware (wood, fans, PSUs, etc.)
-	assembly of pillars
	- progress 0/X
-	fine tuning
	- camera focus
	- meshroom settings
	- filtering settings
-	development of GUI for settings and execution (probably with Qt)
(-	possible cloud integration for upload and download of scanned models)
