# HSkAnner 3D
3D scanning using a network of Raspberry Pies with camera modules and photogrammetry. This project is funded and overseen by Hochschule Karlsruhe - Technik und Wirtschaft and developed by Benedikt Reinberger. This project involves the design and assembly of a complete 3D scanner. If you want to build your own, this may be a good starting point.

# this project is still a WIP, and documentation will follow once finished.
