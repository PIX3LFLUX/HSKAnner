# Purpose
#   Script for interfacing with compound pi, since using the command line interface sometimes fails (hangs the command line) for unknown reasons. Written with guidance from https://compoundpi.readthedocs.io/en/release-0.4/batch.html#compoundpiclient and https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_command_line_arguments.htm
#   This script only captures images with the SN, for setting the settings, use cpi_apply_settings.
####
# Usage
#   python2 cpi_capture.py <int number_sensor_nodes> <str output_dir> <ip/cidr network_addr> <float wait_time>
# ip/cidr notation: Give network, set host to 0 and give the number of ones in the subnet mask after a '/'.
# Examples: 192.168.0.0/16; 192.168.1.0/24; 192.0.0.0/8; ...
# Directories should be put in as absolute, so from the filesystem root '/' up.
# The wait time is used as a self timer and to sync the captures. Note that it always takes longer to take the image than the wait time because there are more things to do until a capture can be done and I use the built-in delay function of compound pi, since that ensures capture sync (all cameras triggered at the same time).

            client.capture(count=1,video_port=False,quality=90) # take 1 shot, with the high quality port. no wait time means no synced capture, but also no dependency on NTP sync.
        else:
            client.capture(count=1,video_port=False,quality=90,delay=wait_time) # take 1 shot, with the high quality port. wait for user defined wait time to sync captures. NOTE: if the NTP server has not synced the RPi, and the timestamp is in the past, CPI hangs and locks the servers. A reboot of clients and server is needed in that case.
